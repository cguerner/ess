# What Makes Europeans Happy

Using data from the European Social Survey, I sought out to understand which factors are most influential, positively and negatively, 
in determining the happiness of Europeans.   

## Install

requirements.txt file lists the dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Data:
* Go to the download wizard and download data for all countries, editions and variables: http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/downloadwizard/
* Run import.py script after specifying the path of the raw data at the top of the script. Specify the path of the pickle file to be exported, again at the top of the file.

Open terminal, make sure the working directory is the project folder, then execute the following command in terminal:
> jupyter notebook

In the browser window that pops up, open "analysis.ipynb". Code can be executed within the Notebook window.
